# daftpunktocat

I saw [James Kang](https://github.com/jeejkang)'s [Daftpunktocat](http://octodex.github.com/daftpunktocat-thomas/) so I had to hook it up to the web audio API.

Art by [James Kang](https://github.com/jeejkang) and music by [Daft Punk](http://www.daftpunk.com), and all the props and copyrights that they hold. Made with love, beer and an appropriation of remix culture.
